# Code-Review-Activity

Code repo for conducting paper presentation group activity (Feb23 group) for CS5704 under Prof. Brown, Virginia Tech.

Here's an activity for you guys, go through the files in this repo and find out how can they be improved. Corrections can be in code logic or failure handling.  
You can submit your changes as pull requests so I can review and merge.
